## Executive Summary

Your roof receives strong year-round sunlight, and the Google Solar analysis confirms that a `[9.6 kW]` system would offset roughly `[92%]` of your annual electricity use. With the recommended configuration, you can expect first-year savings of approximately `[\$1,870]`, a simple payback around `[8.4]` years, and lifetime savings near `[\$44,500]`. Factoring in incentives and appreciation, solar is projected to add `[\$18,000]` to your home’s value and improve its resale velocity compared with similar non-solar listings.

## Roof & Site Conditions

- **Primary array location:** Prioritize the `[south-southeast]` roof plane; it achieves `[94%]` of optimal efficiency with `[1,920]` annual sunshine hours and supports `[24]` standard panels (`[9.6 kW]`).
- **Secondary capacity:** The `[southwest]` plane adds room for `[10]` more panels if you want additional offset, still performing at `[82%]` efficiency.
- **Shading outlook:** Average shading is only `[8%]`, with the highest losses `[15%]` between `[3–5 PM]`. Routine tree trimming will keep production on track.

## System Design & Production

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Recommended system size | `[9.6 kW]` |
| Expected year-one production | `[13,850 kWh]` |
| Monthly production range | `[920–1,380 kWh]` |
| Seasonal variation | Peak in `[June–August]`, dip in `[December–January]` |

The proposed array covers almost all of your annual consumption. Even after accounting for a `[0.5%]` annual panel degradation, 25-year energy production remains strong thanks to the favorable roof orientation.

## Financial Outlook

- **Turnkey cost (before incentives):** `[\$32,900]`
- **Federal ITC (30%):** `[\$9,870]`
- **State + local incentives applied:** `[\$2,500 Austin Energy rebate + \$1,200 state property tax exemption]`
- **Net customer cost:** `[\$19,330]`
- **Loan option:** `[10-year, 4.99% solar loan ≈ \$204/mo]`

Under these assumptions, cumulative cash flow turns positive in `[year 8]`. Over 25 years, total bill savings of `[\$63,800]` outweigh maintenance, financing costs, and residual utility spend, leaving a net benefit of `[\$44,500]`.

## Property Value & Resale Impact

Based on market studies for Texas, every installed kilowatt adds roughly `[\$1,875]` to home value. Installing `[9.6 kW]` therefore contributes an estimated `[\$18,000]` in equity. Solar-equipped homes in comparable markets sell `[20–25%]` faster because buyers lock in lower operating costs—an important differentiator if you list the property in the future.

## Action Plan

1. **Finalize design:** Confirm the `[24-panel]` layout on the `[south-southeast]` plane and optional expansion areas.
2. **Secure incentives:** Submit the `[Austin Energy rebate]` reservation and gather supporting documents for the federal tax credit.
3. **Schedule installation:** Coordinate the `[2-day]` install once permits clear (`[~3 weeks]`).
4. **Post-install optimization:** Enroll in net metering, set up system monitoring, and schedule annual shade checks.

With these steps, you’ll capture the financial upside of solar while boosting your home’s curb appeal and marketability.
